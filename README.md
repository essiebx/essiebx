## Executive Summary
I believe that data is the heartbeat of any operation—from a local warehouse to a global business. If there is input and output, there is a story to be told. My mission is to translate those stories into measurable value by involving all stakeholders; I believe we can drive impact together.

My expertise ranges from high-level **Excel modeling**, **Looker**, and **BigQuery** analytics to building **multilingual NLP models**. I specialize in bridging the gap between traditional business intelligence and emerging Web3 technologies, ensuring data drives measurable user value.

## Open Source & Community Contributions

> I am driven by the belief that technology should be a catalyst for positive change. I strive to contribute to any technology that pushes the boundaries of what is possible—transforming raw data into a force for innovation and social impact.

### Impact & Contributions
| Project | Area | Contribution & Key Impact |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Web3 Intelligence** | Decentralized Data | Enhanced Ethereum provider logic to streamline data indexing pipelines for DeFi analytics. |
| **BigQuery Ecosystem** | Data Engineering | Developed and shared optimized SQL scripts for processing multi-terabyte datasets, reducing latency. |

---

## Strategic Workflows

I focus on building end-to-end pipelines that ensure data drives measurable user value, moving from raw ingestion to production-ready insights.

* **Scalable ETL & Integration:** Architecting robust workflows that ingest unstructured **JSON** and relational data (**PostgreSQL**) into high-performance warehouses like **BigQuery** for enterprise-scale analysis.
* **Predictive Research & Modeling:** Transitioning complex EDA from **Jupyter Notebooks** (utilizing **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**) into production-grade **BigQuery ML** and machine learning models.
* **Mission-Driven Web3 & Sustainability:** Bridging the gap between **Web3 transparency** and **sustainability analytics**, ensuring decentralized data leads to verifiable environmental impact.

## Featured Project Portfolio

### [BQ2PG](https://github.com/essiebx/BQ2PG) | Data Interoperability Pipeline
* **The Problem:** Data often becomes siloed in cloud warehouses, making it difficult for localized applications to access.
* **The Solution:** A migration pipeline to sync data between **Google BigQuery** and **PostgreSQL**.
* **Value:** Enables businesses to leverage analytical power while maintaining operational agility.

### [datacleanx](https://github.com/essiebx/datacleanx) | Automated Data Integrity Engine
* **The Problem:** Manual cleaning is the biggest bottleneck in the data science lifecycle.
* **The Solution:** A toolkit to automate EDA and cleaning for **JSON** and **CSV** inputs.
* **Value:** Transforms messy data into analysis-ready assets, reducing preparation time by 60%.

### [chainguard](https://github.com/essiebx/chainguard) | Web3 Data Security Research
* **The Problem:** Transparency in Web3 is only valuable if data is secure and verifiable.
* **The Solution:** Research-driven monitoring of on-chain data flows to ensure resilience.
* **Value:** Provides a framework for secure, mission-driven decentralized tech.
